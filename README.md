# My Blogs 📝

This repository houses the code for an semi-automated system that transforms my Notion notes into blog posts (first drafts mostly) using AI.

It leverages a **Notion MCP server** to connect and retrieve my notes. **AI agents in VS Code/Cursor** then process these notes to generate the initial drafts of my blog posts according to my writing style, streamlining my content creation workflow.
